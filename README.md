# CodeAlpha_Linear-Regression

This porject is part of internship with CodeAlpha. In this task, I was required to apply **Linear Regression** on a dataset. I chose a dataset that was srelated to **Medical Insurace Charges**. I was able to develop a model with the help of Python's Pandas and SciKit-Learn libraries.

The model is able to predict charges for Medical Insurance by considering 6 factors:
<ol>
  <li>Age</li>
  <li>Sex</li>
  <li>Body Mass Index</li>
  <li>Number of Children</li>
  <li>Smoking Habits</li>
  <li>Region</li>
</ol>
